# learn cli text processing

wip: i'm adding exercises soon.

just type `./exercise.sh` to start your journey!
use various command line tricks or anything you can think of *nix utilites to solve exercises.

```bash
# start with random exercise
./exercise.sh
# start with specific exercise you want
exercise_id=sum.e ./exercise.sh
```

## design goals

- fast iteration
- easy to contribute
- maximize portability - so everything in bash
- mostly lowercase since it looks more... friendly?

## background

inspired by:
- https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing
