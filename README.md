# learn cli text processing

wip: i'm adding exercises soon.

just type `./exercise.sh` to start your journey!
use various command line tricks or anything you can think of *nix utilites to solve exercises.

## design goals

- fast iteration
- easy to contribute
- maximize portability - so everything in bash
- mostly lowercase since it looks more... friendly?

## background

inspired by:
- https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing
- https://github.com/igrigorik/vimgolf

i made this to study shell scripting and be familiar with *nix utilities. hope you find this helpful too!
